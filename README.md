# keel

keel is an engineering loop for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) and Codex. The main session you talk to is the lead, `ponytail` builds, and `critic` reviews.

> **keel is adapted from [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) by Lauren Tan ([poteto](https://x.com/poteto)).**
> pstack's method, skills, playbooks, principles and writing are hers, released under the MIT license, apart from material pstack itself adapted from others, which [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](./THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) credits. keel ports them from Cursor to Claude Code and Codex and reorganizes the agents around them, so the credit for how keel works belongs to pstack first. keel is an independent project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Lauren Tan, Cursor, Anthropic or OpenAI. See [credits and license](#credits-and-license).
> In this README, lowercase passages are pstack's original text, lightly adapted. Sentence-case passages are keel's.

## what it is

- **The lead** is the main session. For real engineering work it loads the [Claude Code](./skills/lead/SKILL.md) or [Codex](./codex/skills/lead/SKILL.md) lead skill, routes the task to one of 23 playbooks, and owns the design, plan, review and verification. Small asks it just does.
- **ponytail** ([Claude agent](./agents/ponytail.md)) owns one slice or pull request end to end: build, test, prove it on the real artifact, commit. In Codex, the lead gives that brief to a worker. A ponytail owner merges only under autopilot or when its brief says to land it.
- **critic** ([Claude agent](./agents/critic.md)), generalized from pstack's comment-review persona, Comment Sicko, reviews a diff through one lens: comments by default, or correctness, security, simplicity, tests or user impact. Codex gives the same brief to an independent reviewer.

keel keeps 46 of pstack's 47 skills (its 23 principles are among them) and all 23 playbooks. [Differences from pstack](#differences-from-pstack) lists what changed.

## install

### Claude Code

keel needs Claude Code, `git`, the GitHub CLI `gh` (signed in), `python3` for the git guard and `bun` for the playbook scripts. Optional: the Codex CLI for the cross-model review lane, `tmux` for driving interactive terminal apps, and Graphite (`gt`) for the Orchestrate playbook's stacks.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add tristanphvn/keel
claude plugin install keel@keel
```

To try it for one session without installing, clone the repository and run `claude --plugin-dir ./keel`.

Skills run as `/keel:<name>`, and the agents are `keel:ponytail` and `keel:critic`. The main session loads `lead` on its own when a task needs it, or you type `/keel:lead`. The other keel skills are user-invoked, so `lead` reads them by path when a step needs one.

### Codex

Codex needs its CLI with plugin support, `git`, and `bun` for Keel's playbook scripts. Playbooks that use GitHub also need the GitHub CLI `gh` signed in. Add the keel marketplace, then install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add tristanphvn/keel
codex plugin add keel@keel
```

Start a new Codex session after installation. Ask for nontrivial engineering work or invoke `$keel:lead` directly. The Codex lead reads the same playbooks and principles from the installed plugin. It delegates scoped work to Codex workers and uses independent reviewers with keel's critic brief. Codex does not install Claude Code's named agents or model aliases.

Codex's workspace-write sandbox blocks the network, allows writes only in the workspace and temporary directories, and keeps the repository's `.git` read-only. The lead asks you to approve each command that needs more:

- Network calls, such as `git fetch`, `git push`, `gh`, and each `watch-pr` run.
- Writes outside the workspace, such as the first run of keel's playbook scripts, which installs their dependencies into the plugin.
- Git writes, such as commits and `git worktree add`.

To allow git writes for a whole session, start or resume Codex with `--add-dir` and the repository's `.git` directory. Sandboxed commands can then also change that repository's Git config and hooks. The Orchestrate and multi-phase plan playbooks keep their state in `keel-store/` in your Codex home (`~/.codex` by default). To let the lead write there, add `--add-dir "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/keel-store"`, or add that directory's absolute path to `sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots` in the home's `config.toml`. Otherwise the lead keeps that state in a temporary directory.

Codex asks you to review the lead reminder in `/hooks` before it runs. The Codex plugin does not load Claude Code's Git guard. That guard is a best-effort check of the command text, so do not rely on it as a Codex safety check.

For Claude Code, keel ships two hooks:

- [`hooks/git-guard.py`](./hooks/git-guard.py), adapted from Matt Pocock's [git guardrails](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT), blocks force-pushes, deleting a protected branch on the remote, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `filter-branch`, `filter-repo`, and commands that discard the whole working tree, such as `git checkout .` and `git checkout -f`. The protected branches are `main`, `master`, `trunk`, `develop` and `release*`. The one exception is `--force-with-lease` onto a branch that the command names and that is not protected, so an owner can publish its own rebased branch with `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>`. The guard catches the common forms an agent types by accident, including commands wrapped in `bash -c`, `eval`, `$(...)`, subshells, heredocs fed to a shell, launchers such as `sudo` or `xargs`, and abbreviated options. It skips quoted text, so a commit message that mentions `git push --force` still runs, but it blocks an unquoted mention such as `echo git reset --hard`. It is not a sandbox. Deliberate constructions get past it, such as brace or glob expansion in the command name, git-core helper paths, plumbing commands, inline `-c` config, and pathspec magic. A git alias, a script file, a heredoc piped into a shell, a flag built at run time, and a command string passed to `ssh` or another language also get past it. To protect a branch, turn on your forge's branch protection. On GitHub, add a ruleset that blocks force pushes and deletion. Set `KEEL_BLOCK_AI_TRAILERS=1` to also block commits whose message carries an AI attribution trailer.
- [`hooks/lead-reminder.sh`](./hooks/lead-reminder.sh) re-injects one line on every prompt, as pstack's sticky reminder does in Cursor: a new task that needs rigor loads `keel:lead`. Set `KEEL_REMINDER=off` to silence it.

## get started

For Claude Code:

1. Run [`/keel:setup`](./skills/setup/SKILL.md) to choose models. It writes `keel-models.md` in the active Claude config directory, `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}`, so each profile keeps its own.
2. Give the main session real engineering work, or start with [`/keel:lead`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md). Once entered, lead mode stays on across turns.

Subagents live only as long as their session. Before you close the terminal on running work, type `/bg` to move the session to the background. Start unattended work with `claude --bg`. keel runs subagents inside subagents, so don't cap `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS` below its default of 20.

New here? The [keel guide](./docs/guide/README.md), adapted from pstack's guide, walks through a first real task.

### models

Claude Code subagents take a model alias, not a vendor slug. keel's defaults:

| role | pstack default (Cursor) | keel default |
|---|---|---|
| code delegates: feature, refactoring, bug fix, perf, hillclimb | `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` | `inherit` (the lead's model) |
| judgment, prose, hardest tasks | `claude-opus-5-5-max` | `inherit` |
| explorers, investigators, swarm workers, reflect tooling | `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`, `gpt-5.6-sol-max` | `sonnet` |
| synthesizers, explainers, reflect's judgment and divergent reviewers | `claude-opus-5-5-max` | `opus` |
| arena runners, architect runners, arena cross-judge pool | opus / sol / grok | `opus, fable, sonnet` |
| interrogate reviewers | opus / sol / grok | `opus, fable, sonnet, codex` |

`codex` is not a subagent: `interrogate` runs `codex exec --sandbox read-only` from bash with the same brief as the other reviewers, and skips that lane when the Codex CLI is not installed.

## usage

The examples below use Claude Code slash commands. In Codex, use `$keel:lead` or give the lead a nontrivial engineering task.

use [`/keel:lead`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md) at the start of a task. it reads your request, picks from a set of playbooks, and runs the other skills as the steps need them.

### just use [`/keel:lead`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md)

this skill is the main shortcut. use it whenever you need the agent to do rigorous engineering work. it comes with twenty-three playbooks:

```
/keel:lead this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even when idle. repro
first, then fix and verify.
```

```
/keel:lead i'm going to bed. land the stack even if ci flakes. i want everything merged by
morning.
```

</details>

when invoked it:

1. matches your task to a [playbook](./skills/lead/playbooks/) and opens a todo list whose first items are its steps, copied in verbatim.
2. routes to the other skills as the steps fire.
3. writes unslopped replies framed for the consumer and the maintainer.

the full rules and playbooks live in [`skills/lead/SKILL.md`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md).

[`/keel:lead`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md) is also a sticky mode: once entered it stays on across turns, applying itself when a playbook matches or the task needs rigor and staying out of the way otherwise. opt out any time by saying so.

[`/keel:lead`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md) works extremely well with claude code's `/loop` command. you can make claude code work for many hours without sacrificing rigor.

## skills

[`/keel:lead`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md) runs most of these for you when a step needs them (`how`, `why`, `architect`, `arena`, `swarm`, `interrogate`, `unslop`, `no-comments`, `technical-writing`, `tdd`, and the principles). the table below is for when you want one directly:

```
/keel:how do we cancel runs? do we have an n+1 when we look up every run to cancel?
```

```
/keel:interrogate review this pr.
```

### examples

mostly you give the lead a task, or type [`/keel:lead`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md) at its start, and let it route to a playbook. the other skills fire as the steps need them. a few are worth reaching for directly.

## ponytail and critic

The lead delegates code-writing to [`keel:ponytail`](./agents/ponytail.md). ponytail reads `lead` in full, including its principles index, before any work, so the lead and its builders share one set of rules. It runs on the lead's model unless the lead passes another, keeps user-scope memory, may spawn its own subagents within Claude Code's depth limit, and merges its own pull request only under autopilot, after a clean review with CI green on a freshly rebased head, or when its brief says to land it. It never bypasses a review or check the forge enforces. The lead passes `isolation: "worktree"` when two or more builders share a repository.

[`keel:critic`](./agents/critic.md) is the read-only reviewer, one lens per spawn. Its default comments lens keeps poteto's comment-hating persona from pstack. Use it through [`/keel:no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md), which carries out the deletions critic recommends, or through [`/keel:interrogate`](./skills/interrogate/SKILL.md), which spawns one critic per configured model plus the Codex lane.

## principles

twenty-three short skills, one principle each. `lead` indexes them inline and reads that index at task start. the standalone files are there so other skills can reference a principle by name, and so the index can point at the full rule for each.

<details>
<summary>all twenty-three principles</summary>

| principle | group | rule |
|---|---|---|
| [laziness-protocol](./skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) | core | Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem. |
| [foundational-thinking](./skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) | core | Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious. |
| [redesign-from-first-principles](./skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) | core | Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on. |
| [attack-the-premise](./skills/principle-attack-the-premise/SKILL.md) | core | Apply when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Take a census of which actors hold the imbalance before the next fix, then question the premise instead of writing another fix that assumes it. |
| [subtract-before-you-add](./skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) | core | Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base. |
| [minimize-reader-load](./skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) | core | Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope. |
| [outcome-oriented-execution](./skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) | core | Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code. |
| [experience-first](./skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) | core | Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones. |
| [exhaust-the-design-space](./skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) | core | Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing. |
| [build-the-lever](./skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) | core | Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun. |
| [model-the-domain](./skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) | architecture | Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals. |
| [boundary-discipline](./skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions. |
| [type-system-discipline](./skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, refuse to lie to the compiler, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas. |
| [make-operations-idempotent](./skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) | architecture | Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs. |
| [migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis](./skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) | architecture | Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers. |
| [separate-before-serializing-shared-state](./skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) | architecture | Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant. |
| [prove-it-works](./skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles'. |
| [fix-root-causes](./skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) | verification | Trace each symptom to its root cause and fix it there; reproduce first, ask why until you reach it, resist nil-check guards that silence crashes. |
| [sequence-verifiable-units](./skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer. |
| [test-behavior-not-implementation](./skills/principle-test-behavior-not-implementation/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply when you write, change, or keep a test. Call the code the way its users do and assert the result they observe against a literal expected value. If the test would still pass when every imported function returns undefined, rewrite the assertion or delete the test. |
| [guard-the-context-window](./skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) | delegation | Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads. |
| [never-block-on-the-human](./skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) | delegation | Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions. |
| [encode-lessons-in-structure](./skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) | meta | Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text. |

## differences from pstack

keel changes how pstack runs, not what it teaches.

- **Platform.** Cursor's tools become their Claude Code equivalents. The Task tool becomes the Agent tool, Cursor cloud agents become background subagents in worktrees, and pull request operations go through `gh` (the Orchestrate playbook also uses Graphite, `gt`, for stacks). cursor-team-kit's slop and control skills become Claude Code's `/simplify`, Bash (tmux for interactive TUIs) and the browser skills, and Cursor's `create-skill` becomes `anthropic-skills:skill-creator`.
- **Names.** `poteto-mode`, `poteto-agent`, Comment Sicko and `setup-pstack` become `lead`, `ponytail`, `critic` and `setup`.
- **Models.** Claude Code has no grok. Review panels use Opus, Fable and Sonnet, and `interrogate` adds a Codex lane.
- **Shape.** The lead is a skill loaded by the main session, because running a session as an agent replaces Claude Code's own instructions. critic is read-only, ponytail keeps memory, and keel adds the git guard and the lead reminder.
- **Removed.** The benny Slack automation pack, the `make-bot-ui` skill, Cursor's plugin manifest, and pstack's logo and illustrations. They are Cursor-only or pstack's own branding.

## why are there no planning skills?

Claude Code already has a plan mode, and it works well with keel. pstack leaves out planning skills on purpose; its README says "personally, i don't believe in planning. the best spec is code." If you do want a plan, [`/keel:lead`](./skills/lead/SKILL.md) covers it, but it's not a default.

## make it yours

`lead` is adapted from poteto-mode and carries much of poteto's style. You may not want exactly that.

type [`/keel:automate-me`](./skills/automate-me/SKILL.md). it mines your recent transcripts, drafts a `<your-name>-mode` skill from how you've actually worked, and routes through keel underneath. you keep keel as the base and end up with your own routing skill alongside `lead`.

models are configurable too. type [`/keel:setup`](./skills/setup/SKILL.md). it checks for the codex cli and writes `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/keel-models.md`, a small file mapping each role (code, judgment, the review panels) to a model. claude code has no always-applied rule outside CLAUDE.md, so every skill that spawns a subagent reads that file itself and falls back to sensible defaults when it is absent. you override only what you want.

pstack's Cursor model rule file does not carry over. Run `/keel:setup` once in Claude Code. A rerun keeps any role whose model differs from the default.

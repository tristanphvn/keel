# Upstream

keel is a fork of pstack by Lauren Tan (poteto), MIT. keel first made its own Claude Code port of pstack (the translation table below), then renamed and reorganized it (the rename table).

- Upstream: <https://github.com/cursor/plugins>, directory `pstack/`.
- Base: `cursor/plugins@12d587d`, pstack 0.15.5.
- The first commit in this repository is an unmodified copy of `pstack/` at the base. Everything after it is keel.
- Ported from a later upstream commit: `skills/correct/` from `cursor/plugins@9511e60`, with both tables applied. keel adds its One correction section and the `hooks/correct-reminder.py` hook that triggers it.

Removed as Cursor-only or pstack branding: `.cursor-plugin/`, `assets/` (pstack's logo), `docs/guide/images/` (pstack's illustrations), `automations/benny/` and `skills/make-bot-ui/`. On an upstream sync, drop them again.

Every change after the first commit applies two tables and nothing else. The translation table turns Cursor into Claude Code. The rename table then turns pstack into keel. **Re-apply both on every upstream sync, translation first, then rename.** poteto's content, voice, rules, and structure stay as they are.

## Rename table

| Upstream | Claude Code port | keel |
|---|---|---|
| plugin `pstack` | `pstack`, marketplace `pstack-local` | `keel`, marketplace `keel` |
| `skills/poteto-mode/`, `name: Poteto Mode`, `/poteto-mode` | `poteto-mode`, `/pstack:poteto-mode` | `skills/lead/`, `name: lead`, `/keel:lead`. No `disable-model-invocation`, so the main session loads it with the Skill tool. Its opening makes the main session the lead. Its Subagents section adds the `isolation: "worktree"` rule, the critic rule, and the session-lifetime (`/bg`) rule |
| `agents/poteto-agent.md` | `pstack:poteto-agent` | `agents/ponytail.md`, `keel:ponytail`. The builder and owner, with `model: inherit` and `memory: user`. It may spawn its own subagents and merges only under autopilot or when its brief says to land, plus Working method, subagent and merging sections |
| `agents/comment-sicko.md`, `name: Comment Sicko` | `pstack:comment-sicko` | `agents/critic.md`, `keel:critic`. A read-only reviewer with a named lens and `disallowedTools: Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, Agent`. Comment Sicko's text is its default comments lens |
| `skills/setup-pstack/`, `/setup-pstack` | `/pstack:setup-pstack` | `skills/setup/`, `/keel:setup` |
| `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` | `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` | `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/keel-models.md` |
| the agent's store | `~/.claude/pstack-store/<project-slug>/` | `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/keel-store/<project-slug>/` |
| `~/.cursor/projects/`, user skills, plugin cache | `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/pstack/*/` | the same under `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}`, cache glob `*/keel/*/` |
| `/<name>` | `/pstack:<name>` | `/keel:<name>` |
| "pstack" naming this plugin in prose, `pstack/...` paths | "pstack", `<pstack>/...` | "keel", `<keel>/...` |
| `docs/guide/02-poteto-mode.md` | same | `docs/guide/02-lead.md` |
| interrogate reviewers on `generalPurpose` | `general-purpose` | `keel:critic` with the correctness lens, one per configured model. The `codex` lane is unchanged |
| no-comments spawns Comment Sicko, which deletes comments itself | same, as `pstack:comment-sicko` | spawns `keel:critic` with the comments lens. critic only reports, and no-comments carries out the kills |
| Orchestrate sub-coordinator as `generalPurpose` or `poteto-agent` | `general-purpose` or `pstack:poteto-agent` | `keel:ponytail`, which has the Agent tool |

Every `~/.claude/...` path keel writes uses `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}`, so each Claude Code profile keeps its own model file, store, and transcripts. Project paths such as `.claude/skills/` stay as they are.

keel additions with no upstream counterpart: `hooks/git-guard.py` (adapted from Matt Pocock's MIT-licensed git guardrails), `hooks/lead-reminder.sh`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and `bin/upstream-diff.sh`.

Kept on purpose:

- "pstack" and "poteto" where they credit or describe upstream: the README, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, the guide's credit line, source notes in a few skills and agents, and this file.
- The upstream `pstack/` path in `bin/upstream-diff.sh`.
- The bun scripts' code under `skills/lead/scripts/`, apart from the package name (now `keel-lead-tools` in `package.json` and `bun.lock`) and the install-key file name in `bootstrap.ts`.

## Translation table

The Claude Code column shows the port's names. The rename table above maps them to keel's.

| Cursor | Claude Code |
|---|---|
| Task tool, `Task` call | Agent tool, Agent call |
| `subagent_type: generalPurpose` | `general-purpose`, or `Explore` for read-only explorers |
| `subagent_type: "poteto-agent"`, `"Comment Sicko"` | `"pstack:poteto-agent"`, `"pstack:comment-sicko"` |
| `readonly: true/false`, agent mode | Removed. Subagents inherit MCP tools. Read-only work says "read-only: do not edit files" in the prompt or uses `Explore` |
| `run_in_background: true` | Removed. Subagents run in the background and the parent is notified on completion, so never poll or sleep-wait |
| `is_background: true` (agent frontmatter) | Removed |
| `AskQuestion` | `AskUserQuestion` (1 to 4 questions, 2 to 4 options each) |
| `name: Poteto Mode`, `name: Comment Sicko`, `name: Make Bot UI` | `poteto-mode`, `comment-sicko`, `make-bot-ui` (persona text unchanged) |
| Frontmatter `mode`, `reminder`, `icon`, `color` | Removed. The `reminder` text moved into the poteto-mode body as the stay-on rule |
| `/poteto-mode`, `/how`, and other pstack slash references | `/pstack:poteto-mode`, `/pstack:how`, and so on |
| pstack skill invocation | pstack skills set `disable-model-invocation`, so the Skill tool refuses them. Agents read `<pstack>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` instead. poteto-mode names the directory through `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` |
| `claude-opus-5-5-max` (synthesizers, explainers, reflect reviewers) | `opus` |
| `claude-opus-5-5-max` (judgment, prose, hardest tasks) | `inherit` in keel (the port used `opus`) |
| `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` (code delegates) | `inherit` in keel (the port used `sonnet`) |
| `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` (explorers, investigators, swarm workers) | `sonnet` |
| `gpt-5.6-sol-max` (reflect tooling) | `sonnet` |
| Panels (arena runners, architect runners, arena cross-judge pool) | `opus, fable, sonnet`. "Different family" becomes "a different model from the parent" |
| interrogate reviewers | `opus, fable, sonnet, codex`. `codex` runs `codex exec --sandbox read-only` from Bash with the shared reviewer brief, and is skipped when `command -v codex` fails |
| `inherit-parent`, `auto` | Kept, plus `inherit`. All omit `model` |
| Effort suffixes and the budget step | Removed |
| Model family prefixes (`claude-*`, `gpt-*`, `grok-*`) | The aliases `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `fable`, plus `codex` |
| `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` (always applied) | `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, a plain file. Each skill says "Read `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` if it exists; use the role's line, else the default." |
| `deslop` from `cursor-team-kit` | Claude Code's built-in `/simplify`, plus pstack's `unslop` for prose |
| `control-cli` | Drive the CLI or TUI directly through Bash, with tmux for interactive TUIs |
| `control-ui` | `anthropic-skills:chrome-browser`, `anthropic-skills:built-in-browser`, or `anthropic-skills:computer-use` when available, else Playwright via Bash |
| `create-skill` | `anthropic-skills:skill-creator` when available, else the Authoring a skill playbook |
| Cursor's built-in `/babysit` | Dropped. pstack's Babysit playbook is the only one |
| `/goal` | The objective becomes the first todo item and is re-read at each `/loop` tick. The multi-phase plan template also names `/goal` where a Claude Code build has it, because `check-plan.mjs` requires that marker |
| `/loop` in dynamic mode, cloud-sleeper wake chain | `/loop` with no interval (self-paced), or `/loop 30m <prompt>` for audit ticks |
| Cursor cloud agent, `environment: "cloud"`, `cloud_base_branch` | A background subagent with `isolation: "worktree"`, or a separate `claude --worktree` session |
| Origin forge and `origin pr ...` | `gh` only |
| Bugbot | Automated PR review bots (Bugbot, Claude Code review, CodeRabbit, etc.). `references/bugbot-triage.md` keeps its filename |
| The agent's store (path in the system prompt) | `~/.claude/pstack-store/<project-slug>/`, exported as `ORCH_STORE` for `orch` |
| `agent-transcripts/` under `~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/` | `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`, one event per line, subagents under `<session-id>/subagents/`. `<cwd-slug>` replaces every non-alphanumeric character of the path with `-` |
| Cursor restart | Session restart or context compaction |
| Cursor as the product the user runs | Claude Code |
| `pstack/skills/...` monorepo paths, `git show origin/main:pstack/...` | The installed plugin's own files, `<pstack>/skills/...` |
| `.cursor/skills/`, `.cursor/worktrees/` | `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/worktrees/` |

## Not ported

- `automations/benny/` runs on Cursor automations and Slack. Removed.
- `skills/make-bot-ui/` drives Cursor's bot routines (`update_state`, `SendToUser`, `api2.cursor.sh`). Removed.
- `docs/guide/` got a light pass only: install, the model file, `/simplify`, `/loop`, and `.claude/skills/` paths. Its `/name` examples keep upstream spelling under a note that they run as `/keel:name`.

## Scripts left as upstream wrote them

`skills/lead/scripts/` is unchanged apart from the package name. Its Cursor-specific parts:

- `worktree-audit.sh` reads chat transcripts from `~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/agent-transcripts`, so its `LAST_CHAT` column is always `-` on Claude Code. The Worktree cleanup playbook tells the agent to scan `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/projects/` itself and to treat every `safe` row as `verify-recent-chat` until that scan clears it.
- `watch-pr/github.ts` counts review passes only for Bugbot, detected by the author `bugbot` or the `cursor` app with `CURSOR_AUTOMATION_ID` markers. Other review bots show no pass count. The Babysit playbook counts their passes from review history.
- `check-plan.mjs` requires the literal markers `/goal` and `git show origin/main:` in a plan's Program checklist. The plan template keeps both.
- The package was named `@cursor-skill/poteto-mode-tools`; keel renamed it `keel-lead-tools`.

## Sync with upstream

1. See what changed since the base.

   ```bash
   bin/upstream-diff.sh            # stat of pstack/ from 12d587d to upstream main
   KEEP=1 bin/upstream-diff.sh     # same, and keep the clone to read full diffs
   ```

2. Import the new upstream tree on a branch from the unmodified import, so the upstream change lands as one reviewable commit.

   ```bash
   git switch -c upstream-sync "$(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)"
   rsync -a --delete --exclude .git <clone>/pstack/ ./
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: import pstack <version> from cursor/plugins@<sha>"
   ```

3. Merge it into keel and resolve every conflict by re-applying the translation table, then the rename table, to the new upstream text. Git's rename detection carries upstream edits under `skills/poteto-mode/`, `skills/setup-pstack/`, and the two agents over to their keel paths. Move a new upstream file under an old path by hand.

   ```bash
   git switch main
   git merge upstream-sync
   ```

4. Re-apply both tables to files the merge did not conflict on. Start from the two residual scans, which should print only the lines listed as deliberate.

   ```bash
   grep -rnIE 'Task tool|generalPurpose|AskQuestion\b|\.cursor/|cursor-team-kit|deslop|grok|gpt-5\.6|claude-opus-5-5|is_background|readonly:|origin pr|/goal' skills agents README.md
   grep -rnIE 'poteto-mode|poteto-agent|comment-sicko|setup-pstack|pstack-models|/pstack:|pstack:(poteto|comment)|~/\.claude/' skills agents docs README.md
   ```

5. Validate, then update `base` in `bin/upstream-diff.sh`, the base and import commits above, and keel's version in both manifests.

   ```bash
   claude plugin validate .
   claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json
   claude --plugin-dir . plugin details keel
   ```

Deliberate residual-scan hits. The first scan prints the model mapping table and the differences list in `README.md`, the `/goal` line in the multi-phase plan template, and the Cursor-path lines inside the unported scripts. The second prints the credit line in `README.md` and the `poteto-mode` names inside the bun scripts under `skills/lead/scripts/`.

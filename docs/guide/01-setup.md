# Set up keel

In this page you install the plugin, pick which models keel uses, and run your first task. Setup is one command plus a short conversation.

## Install the plugin

Add the repository as a plugin marketplace and install keel from it:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add tristanphvn/keel
claude plugin install keel@keel
```

To try keel for one session without installing, clone the repository and start Claude Code with the plugin directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tristanphvn/keel
claude --plugin-dir ./keel
```

`/plugin` inside Claude Code lists keel once it is loaded. Every keel skill runs as `/keel:<name>`.

## Pick your models

Run:

```text
/keel:setup
```

[`/keel:setup`](../../skills/setup/SKILL.md) checks whether the OpenAI Codex CLI is installed, shows you each role (code delegates, judgment, the review panels) with its model alias (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, or `fable`), and asks what you want. Answer the questions. It writes `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/keel-models.md`, a small file every keel skill reads before it spawns a subagent.

You only override what you care about. A role with no line in the file keeps the skill's default. To restore a default, delete that role's line. A rerun of `/keel:setup` keeps any role whose model differs from the default.

You might be wondering how to keep the model you picked for the session. Set a role to `inherit` and keel omits the subagent `model` field, so the subagent inherits your parent model. `inherit-parent` and `auto` mean the same thing. When the Codex CLI is installed, the `interrogate reviewers` panel also gets a `codex` entry, a cross-vendor reviewer that runs from Bash rather than as a subagent. For a panel role the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, so the list length sets the panel size. Setup also configures `swarm workers`, the default model for every `/swarm` worker unless a race names a model for each arm.

## Accept the verification offer, or don't

At the end of setup, `/setup` looks for a way to prove app behavior in your project, either a `verify-*` skill or an existing harness. If it finds neither, it offers once to generate one with [`/create-verification-skill`](../../skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md).

Say yes and it writes `.claude/skills/verify-<app>/`, a project-local skill that teaches agents to drive your app the way a user does. It proves the skill works once before handing it over. Say no and setup moves on. You can run `/create-verification-skill` yourself any time. [Verify and ship](./06-verify-and-ship.md#create-a-project-verification-skill) covers when it earns its place.

keel skills read the model file each time they spawn a subagent, so the new choices apply right away.

## Run your first task

Pick something real but small, and describe it the way you'd describe it to a colleague:

```text
/lead add a --json flag to this command. text output stays byte-identical. verify both.
```

Watch the todo list. Its first items are the matched playbook's steps copied in, the Feature playbook for this prompt. If `/lead` skips a step, the step stays in the list with `skip: <reason>`, so you can see what it chose not to do.

From here you can type normal follow-ups. `/lead` is sticky. It stays on for the conversation until you opt out by saying so.

Next: [Route work through `/lead`](./02-lead.md).
